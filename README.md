# convert-dfa-to-regular-expression

To use the algorithm you have to create the transition functions and the DFA. The convert it into a GNFA (the GNFA class has a constructor that receives a DFA). Then, call the algorithm!

Importante note, at the moment of creating states for the DFA, it's important to start with one. That is because, when the DFA is converted into a GNFA, it's added a new start state with the 0 representation.

Made in collaboration with David Bucheli ü§ù and my person, Daniel Andrade.
